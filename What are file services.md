In the operating systems course,
we discussed files in depth and how we use and modify them on our OSs. In this lesson, we're going to run
down some of the file services we can use that will allow us to
be productive as an organization. Employees need to be able to
share files with each other, whether that's to collaborate or
exchange information. We talked about shared folders in
Windows in the last course, but in this lesson I'm going to
talk about more scalable and efficient ways to share data,
enter file storage services. File storage services allow us
to centrally store files and manage access between files and groups. You can set up a file storage
server that will let users access a shared directory to modify or
add files and much, much more. In the next lesson,
we'll go into depth on two of the more popular ways you can use to manage,
store, and share files over a network. The other way to maintain
a file storage service is by using a Cloud file storage provider. There are lots of providers that offer
secure and easily managed file storage. You can read about some of the more
popular ones in the supplemental reading. For now, let's see how to manage
a file storage service ourselves.
