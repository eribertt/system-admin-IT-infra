I told you we'd cover printing
services and here we are. While our world is moving more and
more into the digital space, there are still aspects of our lives
that require good old-fashioned paper. Many organizations still use printers, and as an IT support specialist, you have to
manage them as you would any other device. If you have a printer at home, you probably connect it
directly to your computer. Maybe you even print over your
home network through Wi-Fi. Some small organizations can get away
with this type of printer management, but most large organizations have lots of
printers that need to be managed and large volumes of information
that need to be printed. When managing printer IT infrastructure, you need to have a place to
centrally manage all your printers. You'll probably be running
commercial printers that also can report diagnostics
information like low toner levels. Along with managing print essentially,
you'll also need to be able to deploy printer driver software so that your
users can print from their computers. There are a few different ways
that printers can be managed. Setting them up really depends of
how many printers you have and how many people are in your company. In a small company with less than
a hundred people, setting up one or two commercial printers
should be more than enough. To set up a print server, all you have to
do is install a print service on a server. Most of operating systems already come
with a printer service readily available. For example, let's look at Windows. In the Windows server operating system,
there's a Print and Document Services that can be enabled. All you have to do is add your
network printer to the service and install the drivers for those printers,
nice and simple, right? In Linux, a common print server that's
usually pre-installed on machines is CUPS or Common UNIX Printing System,
let me show you. CUPS allows you to easily manage printers
from a simple web URL, you can read more about both the Windows print and document
services and CUPS in the next reading. When your print service set up, you need
to add the printer to the client machine. Just search for printer server name, and
connect to the device and start printing. There are lots of ways you
can optimize this process. When you start learning
about directory services, we'll take you through how to set rules
up on machines so that the printer and their drivers are automatically
installed on a client computer. Another way you can manage printers is
by using the cloud service provider. This allows you to manage your
printers through a web browser. It also lets your users print
through a web browser so no setup is involved on their machines. Printer setup is pretty easy to do. Most of it depends on what printer
service you decide to go with. We've learned a lot about software
services in our IT infrastructure, from importing communication services
to security and now printing. Let's keep charging ahead. In the next lesson,
we're going to discuss platform services.
