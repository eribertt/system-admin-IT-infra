We did a deep dive in DNS, or domain
name system in the networking course. If you need a refresher on it,
make sure to review the material there. As a super quick recap, DNS is what maps human understandable
names to IP addresses. It's an important network
service to set up and maintain when managing
a company's IT infrastructure. If you don't set it up correctly, no one will be able to access
websites by their names. We don't really have to think about
DNS on our personal computers. When you connect a brand new
machine to the Internet and start typing in the web address,
it just works automatically. You don't have to type in IP address or anything, but
something is happening in the background. When you connect to a network,
you're using the DNS server address that was provided by
the router you connected to. It updates your network setting to
use that network server address, which is usually your ISP's DNS server. From there, you're able to
access pretty much any website. So why do you need to set up your own DNS
service if DNS just works out of the box? Well, there's two reasons. First, if you're running
a web service like a website, you want to be able to tell the Internet
what IP address to reach your website at. To do that, you need to set up DNS. The second reason is that you probably
want to work on your server or user machines remotely. In theory, you could remote access
into them through an IP address but you could also just use
an easy to remember host name. To do that you need DNS to map
the IP address to the host name. In the next couple of lessons, we'll
discuss what's needed for DNS setup for websites and internal networks.
