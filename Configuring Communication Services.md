Software services include
a wide range of functions. We'll cover the major ones here. First up is communication services, which enable employees in
a company to talk to one another. Then, the security services, which add a layer of security
protection to our IT infrastructure. We'll also discuss user
productivity services and some of the aspects of managing
software in a business that you'll probably have to
think about in your work. There's lots of software out there that's
used for inter-company communication, like email or phone communication. These are important communication
services, but in this video we're only going to discuss software that's
used in instant communication. Instant communication has drastically
changed how we communicate in both our personal lives and in the workplace. We can have multiple conversations with
different people in real time using chat applications. You probably use something like Facebook
Messenger on your smartphones to chat with your friends. In a business setting, there are similar
methods of instant communication. The first is Internet Channel Relay or
IRC, which is a protocol that's used for chat messages. IRC operates in a client and
server model, so lots of IRC client software can be
used to connect to an IRC server. IRC was widely used in the 1990s as
a way to facilitate all kinds of chats, group chats, individual chats, and more. It's not as widely used today, given the wave of social
media instant chat messages. But if you're considering
setting up an IRC, it is a free alternative
to other chat applications. Paid for options are another
method of instant communication. There are a lot more sophisticated and advanced chat applications out there
that offer Enterprise support. A few popular options are HipChat and
Slack. You can read more about these
in the supplemental reading. There are also other communication
protocols called open IM protocols that are widely used and integrated into
different communication applications. One of the most popular
communication protocols is XMPP or Extensible Messaging and
Presence Protocol. It's an open source protocol used in
instant messaging applications and social networking services. XMPP is even used in Internet of Things
applications, among other things. A few popular and free applications
that use XMPP are Pidgin and Adium. Feel free to check out more about these
alternatives in the supplemental reading right after this video. Instant communications is a fantastic tool you
can use to promote team collaboration and efficiency. When managing an IT infrastructure,
it should be one of the communication services that you consider
implementing for your organization. They'll definitely thank you,
maybe even over instant communication.
