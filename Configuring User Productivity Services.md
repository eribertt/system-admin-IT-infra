In any organization the software that
employees need to do their job is the software that an IT support specialist
managing IT infrastructure needs to provide. Depending on the organization, you might need to get your users things
like software development programs, word processing, graphical editors,
finance software, and so on. Whatever software you provide, there are different things to consider
when using it in a commercial setting that might not have crossed your mind when
you've used a similar software personally. Remember when we discussed software
licensing in an earlier lesson? When you use software, you're doing so under the agreement
of the developer's license. For example,
when you use open source software, the license agreement usually says that
it's free to use, share, and modify. When software is used as a consumer, agreements can say that only
a specific person can use the software. In a business or commercial setting, most software distributors will
have a separate agreement. In most cases,
you can buy ten licenses, and any ten people in your company can use it. If someone leaves the company or
doesn't need the software anymore, you can take their license and
give it to someone else in the company. When considering software licenses,
it's important to review the terms and agreement, then move forward with whatever
option works best for your company. Things get a little more complicated when
it comes to cloud software services. You might have to deal with some
of the same stipulations and also think through whether to purchase
added features for businesses and enterprises, like
dedicated customer support. Whatever method you use
to provide software, whether it's installing
software on every machine or utilizing cloud software services,
there's one thing to keep in mind. Software used as a consumer won't be
the same as software used as a business.
