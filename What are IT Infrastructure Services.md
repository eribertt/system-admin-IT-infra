Welcome back. In the last module, we learn that system administrators have lots
of responsibilities like maintaining infrastructure services. I.T.
infrastructure services are what allowing organization to function. These
include; connecting to the internet, managing networks by setting up the network
hardware, connecting computers through an internal network, et cetera. In this
lesson, we're going to learn about the common I.T. infrastructure services out
there and what you need to know to start integrating them into an organization.
We'll also dig deeper into each infrastructure service individually. We will
focus more on the physical infrastructure services like servers, along with
network infrastructure services that keep your company connected to the
Internet. In short, we'll be servicing all infrastructure services needs.
