There are lots of IT infrastructure
services that keep a company running. In a smaller company,
a single person could be responsible for all these services. In larger companies, teams assist
admins might manage just one service. In this course, we're going to discuss
what you need to set up these services as the sole IT person in the company. We'll also give you an overview of some of
the cloud services that you can utilize if you wanted another company
to run your services. Reminder, as we mentioned before, cloud services are services that are
accessed through the internet like, Gmail. We can access our Gmail accounts
from any computing device, as long as we're connected
to the Internet. By the end of this module,
you should be well versed in what services you'll need to have a functioning
IT infrastructure for your company.
