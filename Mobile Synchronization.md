The great thing about
mobile devices is that you can take
them almost anywhere, but the risk is that they contain all kinds of information that
will be hard to replace. Let's admit it, mobile devices can sometimes be
pretty easy to lose. Think about all that data, personal information
like emails, photos, videos, calendars, health data, location data, you
Candy Crush high score. It's also that you
don't want to lose. So in this video we are going to check out some ways
that you can protect your valuable data even if your mobile device is
damaged lost or stolen. So how did we do this? For each type of important
data on your mobile device, you want to make sure
that the data is synchronized or synced
with another location. When you synchronize data, you make sure that the
data is the same in two or more places.
How does this work? Well if a calendar appointment is only stored on your device, then you need your device with you to view the appointment, plus if you lose
access to the device, you lose all the
appointment details, now you have no
idea what time are supposed to be meeting
your friends for coffee. But if you use a calendar that syncs your data,
you are all good. A calendar that signed into
an online account will sync any schedule changes or new appointments to a central
location in the Cloud. If you sign into the calendar on another device but
using the same account, you will see the same
set of appointments. As an IT support specialist, it's important that
you understand what data and which apps
are critical to your organization and also what's critical to the end
users that you support. Most organizations
will care about business data like email, calendars, and
contact information. You might also have apps
that manage documents, photos, videos and so on. Your challenge is to make sure that if the device is lost, you can still recover the data. The best way to do this
in which you might be responsible for in
your IT support role, is to make sure
business-critical data is synced in at least two places. Lucky for us many mobile
apps automatically sync, in some cases mobile apps already used the Cloud as their
canonical data source. For example, if you sign into an account for your
email and calendar apps, they will probably get all of their data from
servers in the Cloud, or your organization's
local IT infrastructure. If you lose your phone, you could just sign into
the same account on a different device and
get the exact same data. With an app like this, you won't lose any data
if the device is damaged, lost or stolen. It's
pretty cool, right? Some apps can be configured
to every so often automatically sync or back up data to a Cloud storage service. This means that you might lose some data if you lose
access to a mobile device, but the loss will be limited to the time
since the last backup. Other apps might store
their data only on the local device and not be able to back up their
data to the Cloud, in that case you want to
synchronize your data to another location in case something happens to your device. Maybe you remember from an
earlier video how each app on your mobile device has a specific location where
it's allowed to store data. Well IOS and Android both support backing up
this app data to the Cloud. Not only will these
mobile OSs backup app data but also your devices'
accounts and settings, too. Want to know more
