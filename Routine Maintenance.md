When you manage machines for a company, you don't just set it and forget it, you
have to constantly provide updates and maintenance so that they run the latest
secure software. When you have to do this for a fleet of machines, you don't

update all your servers with the latest security patches. You have to find time
to take their services offline, perform the update, and verify that the new
update works with the service. You also don't have to perform an update every
