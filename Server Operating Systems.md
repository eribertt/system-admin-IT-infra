When you want to set up a server, you essentially install a service or
application on that server like a FAS storage service. The net server will
provide those services to the machines that request it. Maybe you thought you'd
install services on, or use operating system like Windows 10. While that's an
option, typically, in an organization, you want to install your services on a
server operating system. Server operating systems are regularly operating
systems that are optimized for server functionality. This includes functions
like allowing more network connections and more RAM capacity. Most operating
systems have versions specifically made for servers. In windows, you have
Windows Server. In Linux, many distributions come with server counter protests
like Ubunta server, which is optimized for server use. Mac OS is also available
in Mac OS Server. Server operating systems are usually more secure and come with
additional services already built in. So, you don't have to set up these
services separately. You can read more about the different server operating
systems in the next supplemental reading. For now, just keep in mind that when
you install services on a server, you should be sure to use a dedicated server
operating system.
