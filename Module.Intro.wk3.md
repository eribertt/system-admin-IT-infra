Welcome back. In the last module, we learned about
the physical infrastructure and network services that are used
in an IT organization. In this lesson, we're going to discuss the other services
that make up an IT infrastructure. The software and the platform services. Software services are the services that
employees use that allow them to do their daily job functions. This can include applications
like word processors, Internet browsers, email clients,
chat clients and so on. Platform services provide a platform for
developers to code, build and manage software applications. This way, developers don't have to deal
with operating system maintenance and other services that are needed to use for
the platform tools. When managing IT infrastructure,
it's important that you implement software services for
your users to enable their productivity. Depending on what type of
company you might manage, you may also need to manage platform
services for software developers.
