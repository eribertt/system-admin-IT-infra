Let's take a bit of a dark turn and talk about disasters. Like it or not,
something at some point will stop working, no matter how much planning you do.
This happens in both small and large companies. It's an equal opportunity
problem. You can't account for everything, but you can be prepared to recover
from it. How? It's super important to make sure that your company's data is
routinely backed up somewhere. Preferably, far away from it's current location.
What if a tornado struck your building? And your backups got swept away with it?
You wouldn't have a building to work in, let alone, be able to recover your
data, and get people up and running again. Later in this course, we'll talk more
about what methods you can use to backup your organization's data, and to
recover from a disaster. We'll try to keep things a little lighter in the
meantime. So far, you've learned a lot about the roles and responsibilities of a
sys admin. Some of it may seem like a lot of work. Some might even seem scary.
Being responsible for keeping data available isn't easy. But it's a rewarding
role in IT, and you're already building your SA or sys admin's skill set by
learning the fundamentals of IT support. Next up, we've got a quiz for you.
