We've talked a little bit about the services that are potentially used in an
organization like file storage, email, web content, et cetera. But there are
many other infrastructure services that you need to be aware of. As an IT
support specialist doing system administration, you'd be responsible for the IT
infrastructure services in your organization. Spoiler alert, there are a lot of
them ahead. As always, make sure to rewatch any lessons if you need some more
time for the material to sink in. Rome wasn't built in a day, you know, and
neither are IT support specialists. So, how about getting network access? That's
a service that needs to be managed. What about secure connection to websites and
other computers? You guessed it, that's also a service that has to be managed.
And managing services doesn't just mean setting them up. They have to be updated
routinely, patched for security holes, and compatible with the computer within
your organization. Later in this course, we'll dive deeper into the essential
infrastructure services that you might see in an IT support specialist role.
