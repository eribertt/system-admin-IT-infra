Not only do sys admins in a small
company work with using computers, they also have to deal with printers and
phones, too. Whether your employees have cellphones or desk phones,
their phone lines have to be set up. Printers are still used in companies,
which means they have to be set up so employees can use them. Sys admins might be responsible for making sure printers are working or
if renting a commercial printer, they have to make sure that
someone can be on site to fix it. What if a company's fax
machine isn't working? If you don't know what a fax machine is,
that's not totally surprising. They've been slowly dying
since the invention of email. Fax machines are still alive and
kicking at companies, and they're a big pain to deal with. Sys admins could be responsible for
those, too. Video-audio conferencing machines, yep,
they probably need to handle those, too. In an enterprise setting, sys admins have to procure this
hardware one way or another. Working with vendors or other businesses
to buy hardware is a common practice. Setting up businesses accounts with
vendors like Hewlett Packard, Dell, Apple, etc., is usually beneficial
since these companies can offer discounts to businesses. These are things that sys
admins have to think about. It's typically not scalable just to go
out and purchase devices on Amazon. Although if that's what's decided,
they could do that too. Sys admins must be sure to weigh their
option before purchasing anything. They need to think about hardware supply. So if a certain laptop
model isn't used anymore, they need to think of a suitable backup
that works with their organization. Price is also something to keep in mind. They'll probably need formal
approval from their manager or another leader to establish this
relationship with a vendor. It's not just technical implementations of
hardware that sys admins have to consider. It's so many things.
